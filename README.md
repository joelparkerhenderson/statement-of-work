## Introduction

Wikipedia has good introductions that explain these related concepts:

  * [statement of work (SOW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_of_work)
  * [statement of objectives (SOO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_of_objectives)
  * [performance work statement (PWS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_work_statement)
  * [contract data requirements list (CDRL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_data_requirements_list)

The rest of this page is a statement of work template. The template is based on work by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, using this [statement of work document](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/16/stelprdb1041239.pdf).

We recommend [Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/objectives-and-key-results/).

Identify the most relevant goals, outcomes, and intended uses of the completed work.


### Performance

Describe the performance of the work: how the work is measured, what performance indicators are relevant, and what measurments and metrics are relevant.

We recommend [Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/key-performance-indicator/).

Indentify the most-relevant performance measurements and metrics, for the business aspects (e.g. net revenue, customer satisfaction) and for the technical aspects (e.g. average daily users, percent uptime).


### Factors

Describe the factors that are most-relevant to success of the work.

We recommend [Critical Success Factors (CSFs)](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/critical-success-factor/).

Identify business factors (e.g. personnel availability, budget allocation) and technical factors (e.g. tool availability, software allocation).


## Who does what


### People

Identify all the people who are involved a.k.a. the participants a.k.a. the stakeholders.

Include employees, contractors, consultants, partners, vendors, customers, auditors, investors, advisors, etc., and provide relevant contact information, such as phone numbers, email addresses, messaging usernames, web links, availability hours, etc.

We sugggest creating a document named "people" that contains this information, then continuously improving it.


### Roles

Identify the roles that are involved.

Include employee roles, contractor roles, consultant roles, partner roles, vendor roles, customer roles, auditor roles, investor roles, advisor roles, etc., and provide relevant role information, such as what the role does, its capabilities and limits, etc.

We suggest creating a document named "roles" that contains this information, then continuously improving it.


### Responsibilities

Identify the responsibilities that are involved.

We suggest creating a document named "responsibilities" that contains this information, then continuously improving it. We suggest creating a responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) a.k.a. linear responsibility chart (LRC). We use a RAM called a RACIO matrix. The matrix colums are roles. The matrix rows are areas of responsibility, such as task groupings. The matrix cells are role-task assigments. A matrix cell indicates the role-responsibility assigment as one of Responsible, Accountable, Consultable, Informable, Omittable. A matrix cell may also provide any assigment notes and details.

We recommend [Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM)](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/responsibility-assignment-matrix)
