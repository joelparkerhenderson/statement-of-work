## Introduction

Wikipedia has good introductions that explain these related concepts:

  * [statement of work (SOW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_of_work)
  * [statement of objectives (SOO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_of_objectives)
  * [performance work statement (PWS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_work_statement)
  * [contract data requirements list (CDRL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_data_requirements_list)

The rest of this page is a statement of work template. The template is based on work by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, using this [statement of work document](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/16/stelprdb1041239.pdf).
